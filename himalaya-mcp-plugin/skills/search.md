Search your email using himalaya's filter syntax with a friendly interface.

## Usage

```
/email:search meeting            # Search by keyword (subject/body)
/email:search from:alice         # Search by sender
/email:search --unread           # Only unread messages
/email:search --flagged          # Only starred/flagged messages
/email:search from:boss meeting  # Combine sender + keyword
```

   - Plain keyword → `subject <keyword> or body <keyword>`
   - `from:<sender>` → `from <sender>`
   - `to:<recipient>` → `to <recipient>`
   - `--unread` → `not flag Seen`
   - `--flagged` → `flag Flagged`
   - Date hints ("last week", "yesterday") → `after <date>`
   - Combine with `and`/`or` as appropriate
2. Call `search_emails` MCP tool with the constructed query
3. Format results as a table
