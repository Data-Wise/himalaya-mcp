# /email:reply - Draft Email Reply

Compose a professional reply to an email with safety gates.

## Usage

```
/email:reply <id>                    # Reply to email by ID
/email:reply <id> --tone casual      # Set reply tone
/email:reply <id> --all              # Reply to all recipients
/email:reply <id> "Confirm meeting"  # Include specific instructions
```

## When Invoked

1. Call `read_email` to understand the original message
2. Call `draft_reply` to generate the reply template
3. Show the full draft to the user for review
4. Ask for feedback — user can edit, adjust tone, or approve
5. Only call `send_email` with `confirm=true` after explicit user approval

## Safety Rules

- NEVER send without explicit "yes" / "send it" / "looks good" from the user
- Always show the complete draft before sending
- If user says "change" or "edit", revise the draft and show again
- Default to preview mode (confirm=false) on first pass

## Output Format

```
