# /email:attachments - Email Attachments

List, download, and process email attachments including calendar invites.

## Usage

```
/email:attachments <id>           # List attachments for an email
/email:attachments <id> download  # Download a specific attachment
/email:attachments <id> calendar  # Extract calendar event from ICS
```

## When Invoked

### List Mode (default)
1. Call `list_attachments` with the email ID
2. Display attachment names, types, and sizes

### Download Mode
1. Call `list_attachments` to show available files
2. Ask user which attachment to download (if multiple)
3. Call `download_attachment` to save to temp directory
4. Return the file path for further processing

### Calendar Mode
1. Call `extract_calendar_event` to parse the ICS attachment
2. Display event details (title, date, time, location, organizer)
3. Ask if user wants to add to Apple Calendar
4. Call `create_calendar_event` with `confirm=true` only after user approval

## Safety Rules

- Calendar event creation requires explicit user confirmation
- Downloaded files go to temp directory (OS handles cleanup)
- Always show event details before creating calendar entry
